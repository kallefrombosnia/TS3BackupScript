# TS3BackupScript
NOTE: This project is abandoned, so no support for this. Not recommended for using in production.

This script provides backup system for TS3 server including remote files (icons, avatars etc).

Script is not finished fully but it works in ftp mode only. FTP tested on Windows Env so you should test it before using on other platforms.
 Also you can specify almost anything in config.

### Advanced things of this script are:

* Customizable config file
* Supports multiple virtual servers
* You can save snapshots and files from TS3 dir using FTP mode
* You can choose what you want to download and what to ignore (config.php)

And to mention it again, its not recommended for production use.
